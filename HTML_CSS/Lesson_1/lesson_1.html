<h3>Краткое описание товара</h3>
The Invictor Tactical Warsuit is a stripped-back variant on the Redemptor Dreadnought frame.
Instead of a revenant hero in a sarcophagus, this combat walker is piloted by a live Primaris Space Marine.
They are deployed in every capacity, from armoured escort duties to close-range siege breaking and urban monster-hunts.
Still the most iconic role for these walkers is as the armoured support for Vanguard Space Marines.
Their combination of mid- to close-range firepower, armoured resilience and the selfless mindset of the
pilot combine to provide exceptional support.

<p>
    Like many of the Primaris Vanguard units, an Invictor Tactical Warsuit has the ability to deploy in a concealed
    position outside of your own deployment zone, giving it a unique advantage over any Dreadnought-class vehicle in
    the Space Marines armoury. It has a potent choice of weaponry – if it’s ranged fire support you're after,
    its twin ironhail autocannon has you covered; if you're looking to engage the enemy up close and personal,
    it can instead be armed with an incendium cannon. It also carries a heavy bolter that it can wield as a pistol
    to fire at point-blank range in melee, even as it crushes enemies with its formidable Invictor fist.

<p>
    This multipart plastic model comes in 116 components and is supplied with a Citadel 90mm Round Base and an
    Ultramarines Vehicle Transfer Sheet. You'll find the full rules for the Invictor Tactical Warsuit in Codex:
    Space Marines. The Invictor Tactical Warsuit can also be used in Dark Angels, Space Wolves and Blood Angels armies
    via a free PDF rules download, available from Warhammer-Community.com.
