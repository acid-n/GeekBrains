<h3>Краткое описание товара</h3>
<p>
    Redemptor Dreadnoughts are giant war machines that crush bone and splinter skulls as they bludgeon through enemy
    ranks. Taller, broader and more cunningly wrought than the Dreadnoughts of traditional design, these goliaths of
    battle are powered by hyper-dense reactors and sophisticated fibre bundles. They can accelerate from a thudding
    stomp to a loping, thunderous gait that shakes the ground, barrelling through hails of fire in glorious defiance.
    Such is the miraculous design of the Redemptor’s neural links that its inhabitant, despite being entombed in the
    sarcophagus within the Dreadnought’s chest, can exercise control with surprising dexterity and speed.

    This multi-part plastic kit contains the components necessary to assemble a Primaris Redemptor Dreadnought. Standing
    twice the height of the already-tall Primaris Space Marines – and taller and broader than the standard Dreadnought –
    this is an exceptionally aggressive-looking model that befits its status as a powerhouse on the gaming table. It
    comes with a choice of gatling cannon or plasma incinerator on the right arm, with a Redemptor fist and heavy flamer
    support weapon or gatling cannon on the left, 2 chest-mounted fragstorm grenade launchers or storm bolters and a
    carapace-mounted Icarus rocket pod for aerial denial.
</p>
<p>
    The heavy armour on the chest – replete with flat surfaces and sharp lines, perfect for adding transfers and detail
    – of the Redemptor Dreadnought can be modelled to pivot open, showing the sarcophagus interred within. The
    adventurous hobbyist can remove the pegs from the waist, arms and legs of the model too, allowing for a greater
    range of posing options.
</p>
<p>
    The Primaris Redemptor Dreadnought comes as 109 components, and is supplied with a Citadel 90mm Round base and a
    transfer sheet.
